# Local Environment Setup

## Prerequisites
OpenCabinet was developed on Ubuntu 14.04 using Virtualbox, an operating system virtualization tool which allows you to install a guest operating system on your workstation, and Vagrant, a wrapper for Virtualbox.

To create Ubuntu on your workstation:
- Install [Oracle Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)


## Operating System Setup
Clone the [OpenCabinet](https://github.com/excellaco/open-cabinet) repo to your workspace. Vagrant configuration directives are contained in a Vagrantfile.

In the root of the OpenCabinet project there is a Vagrantfile.example. This file may be used as a template for generating your own configuration.

To have Vagrant configure your development environment:
- Copy the Vagrantfile.example to Vagrantfile
- Run `vagrant up`
 - Vagrant will download and install Ubuntu 14.04, Ruby, and supporting software.
- Run `vagrant ssh` to login to your environment.

## Project Setup
To set-up our project:
- Navigate to the root of the OpenCabinet project on your guest machine (the host OS to guest OS path mapping is given by the `config.vm.synced_folder` directive in your Vagrantfile).
- In the root of the OpenCabinet project, navigate to config/ to find the secrets.yml.sample
 - This file holds sensitive project configuration data.
- Copy secrets.yml.sample to secrets.yml and configure the following values for your development and test environments:
 - `DATABASE_IP` This should match your guest OS IP which is given by the Vagrant `config.vm.network ` directive
 - `DATABASE_USERNAME`
 - `DATABASE_PASSWORD` The database login data. These values are set in the `users` attribute of the `chef.json` section
 - `BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME`
 - `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` The browser login for your OpenCabinet app.
 - `open_fda_import_key` Your [OpenFDA](https://open.fda.gov/api/reference/#your-api-key) development key
- In the root of the OpenCabinet project, navigate to config/environments/.
 - Create a development.rb from the development.rb.sample.


Navigate to the root of your app and run `bundle install`.

Finally run `rake db:create db:migrate` to configure your database.

## Project Commands
To run tests:
- Unit tests: run `rspec`
- Acceptance tests: run `rake cucumber`

To import autocomplete data:
- Run `rake searchable_medicines:import` (logs are available at log/development.log).

To start your local server:
- Run `rails s -b 0.0.0.0`

The app will be available at:
[http://192.168.33.10:3000/](http://192.168.33.10:3000/)

## Docker
You can also run the app in a Docker container within the vagrant VM:
- Run `vagrant ssh`
- Navigate to the root of the OpenCabinet project on your guest machine (the host OS to guest OS path mapping is given by the `config.vm.synced_folder` directive in your Vagrantfile).
- Run `sudo docker-compose build`. After this the only time you will need to run this command is if there are changes to the Dockerfile or Gemfile

#### Docker Commands
Database setup:

- `sudo docker-compose run web rake db:create db:migrate`

To run tests:
- Unit tests: run `sudo docker-compose run web rspec`
- Acceptance tests: run `sudo docker-compose run web rake cucumber`

To import autocomplete data:
- Run `sudo docker-compose run web rake searchable_medicines:import` (logs are available at log/development.log).

To start the image:
- Run `sudo docker-compose up`

The app will be available at:
[http://192.168.33.10:3000/](http://192.168.33.10:3000/)

To stop the image:
- Run `sudo docker-compose stop`

Most rails commands will run in the docker container:

- `sudo docker-compose run web [COMMAND]`
